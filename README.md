# Pandoc Extended Markdown Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin enables Obsidian to render [Pandoc extended markdown syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown), bringing powerful formatting capabilities including advanced lists, superscripts, subscripts, and more to your notes.

## Current Features

Pandoc extended markdown syntax is a huge superset of obsidian markdown. Therefore I cannot implement every single one of them. For now I have implement the ones I found the most useful. Mainly, it's lists and super/subscripts. I am not planning to implement pandoc markdown extended table feature because I think using tables in markdown is painful anyway. 

In addition, live preview mode is the first class citizen. The current reading mode support might need a complete rewrite.

### Superscripts and Subscripts
Render Pandoc-style superscripts and subscripts:
- **Superscript**: `^text^` renders as superscript (e.g., `2^10^` → 2¹⁰)
- **Subscript**: `~text~` renders as subscript (e.g., `H~2~O` → H₂O)
- **Escaped Spaces**: Use `\` to include spaces (e.g., `P~a\ cat~` → P_a cat_)
- Works in all contexts: paragraphs, lists, definition lists, etc.

### Fancy Lists
- **Uppercase Letters**: `A.` `B.` `C.` (In strict mode, there must be two spaces after `A.`)
- **Lowercase Letters**: `a)` `b)` `c)`  
- **Roman Numerals**: `I.` `II.` `III.` or `i)` `ii)` `iii)`
- **Hash Auto-numbering**: `#.` automatically numbers items sequentially
- **Autocompletion**: Press Enter after a fancy list item to automatically continue with the next marker
- **Auto-renumbering**: When enabled, automatically renumbers all list items when inserting new items

### Strict Pandoc Mode

- **Format Command**: Auto-format document to meet Pandoc standards
- **Toggle Setting**: Enable strict Pandoc formatting requirements
- **Validation**: Only renders lists that conform to Pandoc standards
- **Check Command**: Scan document for formatting issues

### Example Lists with Cross-References
Create numbered examples that can be referenced throughout your document:
```markdown
(@good) This is a good example.
(@bad) This is a bad example.

Later in the document, refer to (@good) and (@bad).
```
The references will automatically render the correct example numbers:

```markdown
(1) This is a good example.
(2) This is a bad example.

Later in the document, refer to (1) and (2).
```

#### Features
- **Autocompletion**: Press Enter after an example list item to create a new `(@)` marker with cursor positioned for label entry
- **Autocomplete for References**: When typing `(@` in your document, an autocomplete dropdown will appear showing all available example labels
- **Preview in Dropdown**: The dropdown displays the label name and a preview of the example text (truncated to 30 characters)
- **Duplicate Label Handling**: When the same label appears multiple times:
  - Duplicates are displayed in red with underline instead of being numbered
  - Hovering shows which line has the first occurrence (e.g., "Duplicate index at line 2: (@good) This is a good example.")
  - Only the first occurrence gets a number and can be referenced
- **Label Tooltips**: Hovering over any example list number shows the original label (e.g., hovering over `(2)` shows `@good`)


### Definition Lists
Create structured term-definition pairs with enhanced support:
```markdown
Term 1
:   Definition of term 1
    
    Indented paragraphs are part of the definition

Term 2

~   Alternative definition syntax
~   Can have multiple definitions

Direct Term
: Definition can directly follow term (no empty line needed)

Term 3

  ~ You can also have spaces before the marker

```

- Definitions appear as bullet points
- **Autocompletion**: Press Enter after `:` or `~` markers to continue with the same marker type
- **Enhanced Formatting**: Supports superscripts, subscripts, bold (`**text**`), and italic (`*text*`) within definition content

#### Known Limitations

Due to how Markdown parsers work, there are some limitations with definition lists in reading mode:

- **Definition terms**: Cannot be automatically styled with bold/underline when they appear on separate lines from the definition marker. This is because Obsidian's reading mode renders each line as a separate HTML element.

- **Indented paragraphs**: In reading mode, indented text (using 4 spaces or tab) is treated as code blocks by the Markdown parser before the plugin can process it. This is standard Markdown behavior that cannot be overridden in post-processing.

#### Toggle Definition Styles

The plugin provides commands to toggle formatting styles for definition terms:

**Toggle Definition Bold Style**

- **Implicit bold**: Terms appear bold through plugin styling (e.g., `Term`)
- **Explicit bold**: Terms have markdown bold syntax (e.g., `**Term**`)

**Toggle Definition Underline Style**

- **Implicit underline**: Terms appear underlined through plugin styling (e.g., `Term`)
- **Explicit underline**: Terms have HTML underline syntax (e.g., `<span class="underline">Term</span>`)

These commands are useful for maintaining compatibility with other markdown readers that don't have this plugin installed.

### Auto-Renumbering Lists

The plugin can automatically renumber list items when you insert new items in the middle of a list:

**Without auto-renumbering:**
```markdown
A. First item
[Press Enter here]
B. Second item
```
Result:
```markdown
A. First item
B. [new item]
B. Second item  # Duplicate marker
```

**With auto-renumbering enabled:**
```markdown
A. First item
[Press Enter here]
B. Second item
```
Result:
```markdown
A. First item
B. [new item]
C. Second item  # Automatically renumbered
```

This feature:
- Works with alphabetic lists (A, B, C or a, b, c)
- Works with roman numerals (i, ii, iii or I, II, III)
- Maintains proper sequence even with incorrectly ordered lists
- Respects indentation levels (only renumbers items at the same level)
- Preserves nested list numbering independently


### Beyond Pandoc Extended Syntax!!!

#### Custom Label Lists

*Warning: This is a plugin-specific markdown flavor. Within obsidian, it works out of the box with this plugin. But if you want to you pandoc to do conversion, you need to pass lua filter to pandoc. The lua filter is in /lua_filter/CustomLabelList.lua*

When "More extended syntax" is enabled in settings, you can use custom label lists with the `{::LABEL}` syntax:

```markdown
{::P} All humans are mortal.
{::Q} Socrates is human.
{::R} Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
```

This renders as:

```
(P) All humans are mortal.
(Q) Socrates is human.
(R) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
```

##### Auto-numbering with Placeholders

Custom labels support auto-numbering through placeholder syntax `(#name)`. Each unique placeholder gets a sequential number:

```markdown
{::P(#first)} First premise
{::P(#second)} Second premise  
{::P(#first)'} Variation of first premise

From {::P(#first)} and {::P(#second)}, we derive...
```

This renders as:
- (P1) First premise
- (P2) Second premise
- (P1') Variation of first premise
- From (P1) and (P2), we derive...

You can also use pure placeholder expressions:

```markdown
{::(#premise)} A premise
{::(#conclusion)} A conclusion
{::(#premise)+(#conclusion)} Combined expression
```

Which renders as:
- (1) A premise  
- (2) A conclusion
- (1+2) Combined expression

### List Panel View

A modular sidebar panel displays various list-related content from the active document. The panel features an icon toolbar for switching between different list types.

#### Available Panels

**Custom Label Lists Panel** `{::}`
- Displays all custom label lists from the current document
- Two-column layout: processed labels and their content
- Click labels to copy raw syntax to clipboard
- Click content to navigate to the label in the editor
- Hover previews for truncated content with rendered math

**Example Lists Panel** `(@)`
- Displays all example lists from the current document
- Three-column layout: rendered numbers, raw labels, and content
- Rendered numbers show sequential numbering (truncated at 3rd digit)
- Click labels to copy raw syntax (e.g., `(@a)`) to clipboard
- Click content to navigate to the example in the editor
- Hover previews for truncated items with full content
- Math rendering support in content column

**Definition Lists Panel** `DL:`
- Displays all definition lists from the current document
- Two-column layout: terms and their definitions
- Terms support full markdown rendering (bold, italic, math, references)
- Multiple definitions per term shown as bullet list
- Continuation lines automatically merged with definitions
- Click definitions to navigate to the term in the editor

- Clicking content jumps to the footnote definition block and highlights the line
- Uses the shared rendering pipeline for consistent formatting across panels

## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins (Coming Soon)
1. Open Settings → Community plugins
2. Search for "Pandoc Extended Markdown"
3. Click Install and Enable

### Manual Installation
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ErrorTzy/obsidian-pandoc-extended-markdown/releases)
2. Create a folder named `pandoc-extended-markdown` in your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy the downloaded files into the `pandoc-extended-markdown` folder
4. Reload Obsidian
5. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins

## Usage Examples

### Superscripts and Subscripts
```markdown
Water formula: H~2~O is essential for life.
Einstein's equation: E = mc^2^ revolutionized physics.
Chemical notation: Ca^2+^ + SO~4~^2-^ → CaSO~4~
With spaces: P~a\ cat~ subscript example
```

### Fancy Lists
```markdown
A. First major point
B. Second major point
C. Third major point

i. First sub-item
ii. Second sub-item
iii. Third sub-item

#. Auto-numbered item one
#. Auto-numbered item two
#. Auto-numbered item three
```

### Example Lists
```markdown
(@intro) This introduces the concept.
(@) This example doesn't need a label.
(@conclusion) This concludes our examples.

As shown in example (@intro), the concept is straightforward.
Example (@conclusion) wraps everything up.
```

### Definition Lists
```markdown
Markdown
:   A lightweight markup language

Obsidian
:   A powerful knowledge base application
:   Uses local Markdown files

Plugin
~   Extends Obsidian functionality
~   Can be installed from Community Plugins
```

## How It Works

- **Live Preview Mode**: Lists are rendered with proper formatting. When the cursor is within a list marker, it shows the raw markdown for editing
- **Reading Mode**: Lists are fully rendered with enhanced styling
- **Source Mode**: Original markdown syntax is always preserved without any rendering
- **Strict Mode**: When enabled, only lists conforming to Pandoc standards are rendered

## Settings

The plugin provides a settings tab where you can configure:

- **Strict Pandoc Mode**: Toggle to enforce Pandoc formatting standards
  - When enabled, lists must have proper empty lines before/after blocks
  - Capital letters with periods require double spacing
  - Invalid lists are displayed as plain text

- **Auto-renumber lists**: Toggle automatic renumbering of list items
  - When enabled, inserting a new list item automatically renumbers all subsequent items
  - Ensures proper sequential ordering of fancy lists (A, B, C... or i, ii, iii...)
  - Only affects alphabetic and roman numeral lists, not hash (#.) or example (@) lists

- **More extended syntax**: Enables additional extensions beyond pandoc markdown
  - Custom label lists using `{::LABEL}` syntax for flexible list markers
  - Should be used together with lua_filter/CustomLabelList.lua for Pandoc output
  - When strict mode is enabled, custom label blocks require blank lines before/after

## Commands

The plugin adds the following commands to the command palette:

- **Check pandoc formatting**: Scans the current document and reports any formatting issues
- **Format document to pandoc standard**: Automatically formats lists to conform to Pandoc standards
- **Toggle definition list bold style**: Toggles all definition terms between explicit (`**Term**`) and implicit (styled) bold formatting
  - If any term has explicit bold, removes bold from all terms
  - If no terms have explicit bold, adds bold to all terms
- **Toggle definition list underline style**: Toggles all definition terms between explicit (`<span class="underline">Term</span>`) and implicit (styled) underline formatting
  - If any term has explicit underline, removes underline from all terms
  - If no terms have explicit underline, adds underline to all terms

## Compatibility
